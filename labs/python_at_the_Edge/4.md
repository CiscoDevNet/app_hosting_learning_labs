# Embedded Event Manager

Embedded Event Manager (EEM) policies support Python scripts. You can register Python scripts as EEM policies, and execute the registered  Python scripts when a corresponding event occurs. The EEM Python script has the same event specification syntax as the EEM TCL (Tool Command Language) policy.

Configured EEM policies run within the guest shell using the included Python interpreter.

## Python-Supported EEM Actions
The Python package is available only within the EEM script, and not available for the standard Python script. It supports the following EEM actions:

- Syslog message printing
- Send SNMP traps
- Reload the box
- Switchover to the standby device
- Run a policy
- Track Object read
- Track Object Set
- Cisco Networking Services event generation

Next, configure the event manager applet to run a Python script in response to an event.

Here we create an event called 'interface_Lo100_Shutdown' from the router command line to trigger an event. This event then has a regular expression to perform the syslog message pattern match. We have to specify a directory to use for storing user library files or user-defined EEM policies. You must have a policy in the specified path. In the next step, the `eem_script.py` policy is available in the flash:/user_library folder or path. Then specify a regular expression pattern string that will match the next solicited prompt.

```
device-xe(config)#event manager applet interface_Lo100_Shutdown
device-xe(config-applet)#event syslog pattern "Interface Loopback100, changed state to administratively down"
device-xe(config-applet)#action 0.0 cli command "en"
device-xe(config-applet)#action 1.0 cli command "guestshell run python /flash/app_hosting_code_samples/python_onbox/eem_intf_up.py lo100"
device-xe(config-applet)#exit

```
Now, manually trigger the event from the CLI, but when shutting down interface loopback 100, we build this series of actions in the command line.

```
!Enable terminal monitor
device-xe#terminal monitor
!Start debug for the event manager
device-xe#debug event manager action cli
!Enter configurations mode and trigger the event
device-xe#conf t
device-xe(config)#int lo100
device-xe(config-if)#shut

```

Here the Python script `eem_intf_up.py` is triggered due to us shutting the loopback 100 interface. The Python script executes and the interface shows 'no shut' plus its state changed to 'up'.

## Summing it up

In this lab we looked at what was required to enable us to run Python scripts within the guest shell, how we can use the Python interpreter and some of the features within the Python interpreter. Within the Python interpreter we confirmed the routers configuration and even add new configurations. We looked at Zero-Touch Provisioning, which enables a device to retrieve configuration files from a remote DHCP server during initial deployment with no end-user intervention. Finally we configured Embedded Event Manager
(EEM) policies and saw the supporting Python scripts.
