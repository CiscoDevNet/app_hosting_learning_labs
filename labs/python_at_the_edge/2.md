# Using Python for Network Programming

Python can be used interactively or Python scripts can be run in the Guest Shell. Use the guest shell run python command to launch the Python interpreter in Guest Shell and open the Python terminal.

The following table defines the difference between 'On' and 'Off' box python.

|*"On-Box" Python* |*"Off-Box" Python* |
|------------ | -------------|
|Scripts executed locally on switch or router, Ideal for: |Scripts executed externally from switch or router. Use API to interact with network.Ideal for:|
|Provisioning (ie ZTP)|Configuration management automation|
|Automating event responses (ie EEM)|Telemetry/operational data|
|Application Development|Controller use cases|

## On-Box Python Features in IOS XE and NX-OS
- Interactive Python prompt
- Run Python scripts directly on box
- Includes a Cisco Python API library for interacting with host device
- Integration with Day Zero Deployment (ZTP) and PowerOn Auto Provisioning (POAP)
- Call Python Scripts with Embedded Event Manager (EEM)

## Interactive Python Prompt

At enable prompt `guestshell run python`

```
device-xe#guestshell run python
Python 2.7.5 (default, Jun 17 2014, 18:11:42)

Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> x = "hello world"
>>> print(x)
hello world
>>>
```

- Run Python commands right on box

```
