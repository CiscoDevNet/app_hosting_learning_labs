# Using Python for Network Programming

Python can be used interactively or Python scripts can be run in the Guest Shell. Use the guest shell run python command to launch the Python interpreter in Guest Shell and open the Python terminal.

The following table defines the difference between 'On' and 'Off' box python.

## On-Box Python Features in IOS XE and NX-OS
- Interactive Python prompt
- Run Python scripts directly on box
- Includes a Cisco Python API library for interacting with host device
- Integration with Day Zero Deployment (ZTP) and PowerOn Auto Provisioning (POAP)
- Call Python Scripts with Embedded Event Manager (EEM)

## Interactive Python Prompt

At enable prompt `guestshell run python`

```
device-xe#guestshell run python
Python 2.7.5 (default, Jun 17 2014, 18:11:42)
[GCC 4.8.2 20140120 (Red Hat 4.8.2-16)] on linux2
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> x = "hello world"
>>> print(x)
hello world
>>>
```

- Run Python commands right on box

```
[guestshell@guestshell ~]$ python
Python 2.7.5 (default, Jun 17 2014, 18:11:42)
[GCC 4.8.2 20140120 (Red Hat 4.8.2-16)] on linux2

>>> from cli import *
>>> x = cli ('sh ip route 0.0.0.0')
>>> print x

Routing entry for 0.0.0.0/0, supernet
  Known via "static", distance 1, metric 0, candidate default path
  Routing Descriptor Blocks:
  * 10.10.10.254, via GigabitEthernet1
      Route metric is 0, traffic share count is 1
```
## Python Script

Python scripts can run in non-interactive mode by providing the Python script name as an argument in the Python command. Python scripts must be accessible from within the Guest Shell. To access Python scripts from the Guest Shell, save the scripts in bootflash/flash that is mounted within the Guest Shell.
