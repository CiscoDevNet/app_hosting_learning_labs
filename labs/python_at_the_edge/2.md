# Using Python for Network Programming

Python can be used interactively or Python scripts can be run in the guest shell. Use the `guestshell run python` command to launch the Python interpreter in the guest shell and open the Python terminal.

The following table defines the difference between 'On' and 'Off' box python.

## On-Box Python Features in IOS XE and NX-OS
- Interactive Python prompt
- Run Python scripts directly on box
- Includes a Cisco Python API library for interacting with host device
- Integration with Day Zero Deployment (ZTP) and PowerOn Auto Provisioning (POAP)
- Call Python scripts with Embedded Event Manager (EEM)

## Interactive Python Prompt

At the enabled prompt run `guestshell run python` command and test the Python interpreter.

```
device-xe#guestshell run python
Python 2.7.5 (default, Jun 17 2014, 18:11:42)
[GCC 4.8.2 20140120 (Red Hat 4.8.2-16)] on linux2
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> x = "hello world"
>>> print(x)
hello world
>>>
```

Now, run some Python. The Python interactive mode allows us to execute Python functions from the Cisco Python CLI module to configure the device. For example, have Python issue a 'show route' command.

```
[guestshell@guestshell ~]$ python
Python 2.7.5 (default, Jun 17 2014, 18:11:42)
[GCC 4.8.2 20140120 (Red Hat 4.8.2-16)] on linux2
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> from cli import *
>>> x = cli ('sh ip route 0.0.0.0')
>>> print x

Routing entry for 0.0.0.0/0, supernet
  Known via "static", distance 1, metric 0, candidate default path
  Routing Descriptor Blocks:
  * 10.10.10.254, via GigabitEthernet1
      Route metric is 0, traffic share count is 1
```

## Python Script

Python scripts can run in non-interactive mode by providing the Python script name as an argument in the Python command. Python scripts must be accessible from within the guest shell. To access Python scripts from the guest shell, save the scripts in bootflash or flash that is mounted within the guest shell. 

To run a Python script from the Guest Shell, execute the guestshell run python /flash/script.py command at the device command prompt. The following example shows how to run a Python script from the guest Shell:

```
device-xe# guestshell run python /flash/eem_intf_up.py lo100
```
