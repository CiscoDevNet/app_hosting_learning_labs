# Prerequisites
To prepare your computer for this lab, click the "How to Set Up Your Computer" link at the top of this lab.
Please ensure you have completed Linux at the Edge: Introduction to Guest Shell lab beforehand.

## Cisco Guest Shell Capabilities

Guestshellis a virtualized Linux-based environment,designed to run custom Linux applications,including Python for automated control and management of Cisco devices.Using GuestShell, users can also install update,and operatethird-party Linux applications. Guest Shell containeris managed using IOx. IOx is Cisco's Application Hosting Infrastructure for Cisco IOSXE devices.IOx enables hosting of applications and services developed by Cisco, partners,and third-party developers in network edge devices.

The below table shows the Guest Shell capabilitiesand the supported Cisco platforms

## Why Python for Network Programming?

- Python is the de-facto automation language of the day
- Easy to learn but powerful programming language
- Helps overcome operational shortcomings of CLI
- Provides programmatic access to device’s configuration

## Guest Shell Setup

1. Guest Shell enabled and configured with DNS

```
device-xe#guestshell enable virtualPortGroup 0 guest-ip 192.168.35.2 name-server 208.67.222.222
```

2. “git” installed within GuestShell (if you enabled this in the Linux at the egde lab skip this and confirm git is installed with git version)


```
[guestshell@guestshell ~]$ sudo yum install git
Loaded plugins: fastestmirror
Loading mirror speeds from cached hostfile
 * base: mirrors.coreix.net
 * extras: mirrors.coreix.net
 * updates: mirrors.coreix.net
