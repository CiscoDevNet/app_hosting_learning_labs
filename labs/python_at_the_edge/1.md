Please ensure you have completed Linux at the Edge: Introduction to Guest Shell lab beforehand.

## Cisco Guest Shell Capabilities

Guest shell is a virtualized Linux-based environment, designed to run custom Linux applications including Python for automated control and management of Cisco devices. Using guest shell, users can also install, update, and operate third-party Linux applications. The guest shell container is managed using IOx. IOx is Cisco's Application Hosting Infrastructure for Cisco IOS XE devices. IOx enables hosting of applications and services developed by Cisco, partners, and third-party developers in network edge devices.

The below table shows the guest shell capabilities and the supported Cisco platforms.

## Why Python for Network Programming?

- Python is the de-facto automation language of the day
- Easy to learn but powerful programming language
- Helps overcome operational shortcomings of CLI
- Provides programmatic access to deviceâ€™s configuration

## Guest Shell Setup

To set up the guest shell with `guest-ip` enabled and configured with DNS, use the following command. Note this is done from Privileged EXEC mode and not global configuration mode. Here we use the `guestshell enable` command, create a virtual port group (VPG), and add a DNS name-server.

```
device-xe#guestshell enable virtualPortGroup 0 guest-ip 192.168.35.2 name-server 208.67.222.222
```

Next we can install `git` within the guest shell. (If you already installed `git` in the Linux at the Edge lab, skip this step and confirm git is installed with the `git version` command.)

If a package is already installed, you see a prompt that the package is already installed.

```
[guestshell@guestshell ~]$ sudo yum install git

```

Then, change directory to bootflash/flash and clone the code repo for the lab in the guest shell.

```
[guestshell@guestshell ~]$ cd /flash
[guestshell@guestshell flash]$
[guestshell@guestshell flash]]$ git clone https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/app_hosting_code_samples
