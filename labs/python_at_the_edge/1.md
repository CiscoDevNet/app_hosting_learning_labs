## Cisco Guest Shell Capabilities

Guestshellis a virtualized Linux-based environment,designed to run custom Linux applications,including Python for automated control and management of Cisco devices.Using GuestShell, users can also install update,and operatethird-party Linux applications. Guest Shell containeris managed using IOx. IOx is Cisco's Application Hosting Infrastructure for Cisco IOSXE devices.IOx enables hosting of applications and services developed by Cisco, partners,and third-party developersin networkedge devices.

## Why Python for Network Programming?

- Python is the de-facto automation language of the day
- Easy to learn but powerful programming language
- Helps overcome operational shortcomings of CLI
- Provides programmatic access to device’s configuration
