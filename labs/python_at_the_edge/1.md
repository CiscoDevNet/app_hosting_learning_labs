## Cisco Guest Shell Capabilities

Guestshellis a virtualized Linux-based environment,designed to run custom Linux applications,including Python for automated control and management of Cisco devices.Using GuestShell, users can also install update,and operatethird-party Linux applications. Guest Shell containeris managed using IOx. IOx is Cisco's Application Hosting Infrastructure for Cisco IOSXE devices.IOx enables hosting of applications and services developed by Cisco, partners,and third-party developersin networkedge devices.

The below table shows the Guest Shell capabilitiesand the supported Cisco platforms

## Why Python for Network Programming?

- Python is the de-facto automation language of the day
- Easy to learn but powerful programming language
- Helps overcome operational shortcomings of CLI
- Provides programmatic access to device’s configuration

## Guest Shell Setup

1. Guest Shell enabled and configured with DNS

```
device-xe#guestshell enable virtualPortGroup 0 guest-ip 192.168.35.2 name-server 208.67.222.222
```

2. “git” installed within Guest Shell
```
devce-xe#guestshell run bash
[guestshell@guestshell ~]$ sudo yum install git
```

3. Code repo for lab cloned down

```
git clone https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/app_hosting_code_samples
```
