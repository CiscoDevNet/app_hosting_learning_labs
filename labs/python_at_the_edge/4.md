# Embedded Event Manager

Embedded Event Manager (EEM) policies supports Python scripts. You can register Python scripts as EEM policies, and execute the registered  Python scripts when a corresponding event occurs. The EEM Python script has the same event specification syntax as the EEM TCL policy.

Configured EEM policies run within the Guest Shell. Guest Shell is a virtualized Linux-based environment, 
designed to run custom Linux applications, including Python for automated control and management of Cisco devices. 
The Guest Shell container provides a Python interpreter.


## Python-Supported EEM Actions
The Python package (is available only within the EEM script, and not available for the standard Python script) supports the following EEM actions:

- Syslog message printing
- Send SNMP traps
- Reload the box
- Switchover to the standby device
- Run a policy
- Track Object read
- Track Object Set
- Cisco Networking Services event generation

- Configure the event manager applet to run a Python script in response to the event.

Here we create an event called 'interface_Lo100_Shutdown' from the router command line to trigger an event. This then has a regular expression to perform the syslog message pattern match. We have to specify a directory to use for storing user library files or user-defined EEM policies. You must have a policy in the specified path. In the next step, the eem_script.py policy is available in the flash:/user_library folder or path. Then specify a regular expression pattern string that will match the next solicited prompt.

```
device-xe(config)#event manager applet interface_Lo100_Shutdown
device-xe(config-applet)#event syslog pattern "Interface Loopback100, changed state to administratively down"
device-xe(config-applet)#action 0.0 cli command "en"
device-xe(config-applet)#action 1.0 cli command "guestshell run python /flash/app_hosting_code_samples/python_onbox/eem_intf_up.py lo100"
device-xe(config-applet)#exit

```
- Manually trigger the event from the CLI, but shutting down interface loopback 100 we build via the command line. 

```
!Enable terminal monitor
device-xe#terminal monitor
!Start debug for the event manager
device-xe#debug event manager action cli
!Enter configurations mode and trigger the event
device-xe#conf t
device-xe(config)#int lo100
device-xe(config-if)#shut

```
Here the Python script eem_intf_up.py is triggered due to us shutting the loopback 100 interface being shutdown. The Python script will be executed and the interface will be 'no shut' and its state changed to up.
