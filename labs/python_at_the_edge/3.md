## Installing and Running Python Libraries

When installing python libraries, these are instaled in the same way you would normally install a python libary using pip (package manager). Some of the below installation have been omiited for brevity purposes.

```
device-xe#guestshell run bash

[guestshell@guestshell ~]$ sudo pip install requests
Collecting requests

Installing collected packages: chardet, certifi, urllib3, idna, requests
Successfully installed certifi-2017.7.27.1 chardet-3.0.4 idna-2.6 requests-2.18.4 urllib3-1.22

[guestshell@guestshell ~]$
```

## Cisco Python CLI API

- Permits Python calls to use CLI commands directly and return results - this can be configuration command and show commands
- Integrated into Python interpreter inside Guest Shell which is the built in library that permits the Python container to run native IOS commands as part of a script
- The CLI libary is added with the 'import cli' command in python.The CLI package is a framework for making simple, correct command line applications in Python.

```
 * - NX-OS Only
** - IOS XE Only
```

Here we can use python to issue 'show ip int brief' to show what interfaces are configured. We can also use CLIP. Clip is a command-line interface (CLI) tool that allows you to store and quickly access text snippets and manage your clipboard.
```
device-xe#guestshell run python

>>> import cli

>>> cli.cli("show ip int brief")
'\nInterface              IP-Address      OK? Method Status                Protocol\nGigabitEthernet1       10.10.20.21     YES NVRAM  up                    up      \nGigabitEthernet2       unassigned      YES NVRAM  administratively ..'

>>> cli.clip("show ip int brief")

Interface              IP-Address      OK? Method Status                Protocol
GigabitEthernet1       10.10.20.21     YES NVRAM  up                    up
GigabitEthernet2       unassigned      YES NVRAM  administratively down down
GigabitEthernet3       unassigned      YES NVRAM  administratively down down
VirtualPortGroup0      192.168.35.1    YES NVRAM  up                    up
```

We can also use python to build / configure our router and the validate the new configuration

```
>>> cli.configurep(["int loop100", "desc Python Loop", "ip add 192.168.0.1 255.255.255.0"])
Line 1 SUCCESS: int loop100
Line 2 SUCCESS: desc Python Loop
Line 3 SUCCESS: ip add 192.168.0.1 255.255.255.0

>>> cli.clip("sh run int loop100")

```

## Day Zero Provisioning

Zero-Touch Provisioning providesopen bootstrap interfaces to automate networkdevice provisioning inheterogeneous network environments. When a device that supports Zero-Touch Provisioning boots up,and does not find the start upconfiguration (duringinitial installation),the device enters the Zero-Touch Provisioning mode. The device searches for a Dynamic Host Control Protocol(DHCP)server, bootstraps itself with its interface IP address, gateway, and Domain Name System (DNS) server IP address,and enables Guest Shell.

The device then obtains the IP addressor URL of an HTTP/TFTP server, and downloads the Python script from an HTTP/TFTP server to configurethe device. Guest Shell provides the environmentfor the Python script to run. Guest Shell executesthe downloaded Python script and applies an initial configurati onto the device.

*Note* - After initial provisioning is complete, GuestShell remains enabled

- Automates process of upgrading images and installing configurations
- Returned script might have basic copy information to install both image and configuration file

When the new device is switched on, it retrieves the IP address information of the HTTP/TFTP server where the Python script resides,and the folder path of the Python script from the DHCP server

- Option 150 – (Optional) Contains a list of IP addressesthat points to the HTTP/TFTPserver on the management network that hosts the Python scripts to be run
- Option 67 – Contains the Python script file path on HTTP/TFTP server


After receiving these DHCP options,the device connects to the HTTP/TFTP server, and downloads the Python script. The device,at this point does not have any route to reach the HTTP/TFTPserver, so it uses the default route provided by the DHCP server.
