## Installing and running Applications

Running troubleshooting commands from the guest shell.

- MTR – Combines ping and traceroute. 
- tcpdump – well known Linux packet analyzer
- Custom Python Applications
- Launch Guest Shell apps from Embedded Event Manager applets

Install mtr via yum, note you have to be at 'root' level to be able to install this.

```
[guestshell@guestshell ~]$ sudo yum install mtr
```
```
[guestshell@guestshell ~]$sudo mtr 8.8.8.8

## Summing it up

In this lab, you looked at GuestShell and how GuestShell is a virtualized Linux-based environment and how this is enabled within the XE platform. You also saw how we can run our favorite Cisco IOS commands within the GuestShell and you also installed and looked some of the applications you can run from te GuestShell such as MTR, tcpdump.  

In the next lab we will look at how GuestShell is designed to run custom Linux applications, including Python for automated control and how you can also update and operate third-party Linux applications on Cisco IOX-XE platforms from within GuestShell.
