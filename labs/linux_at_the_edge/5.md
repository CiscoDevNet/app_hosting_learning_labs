## Installing and Running Applications

Running troubleshooting commands from the guest shell works well to make sure everything is working correctly. From the guest shell you can install applications and utilities to diagnose network issues.

- MTR – Combines ping and traceroute 
- tcpdump – Well known Linux packet analyzer
- Custom Python Applications
- Launch Guest Shell apps from Embedded Event Manager applets

Now install mtr with Yum. Note you have to be at the `root` directory level to be able to install this.

```
[guest shell@guest shell ~]$ sudo yum install mtr

## Summing it up

In this lab, you looked at guest shell and how guest shell is a virtualized Linux-based environment and how this is enabled within the XE platform. You also saw how we can run our favorite Cisco IOS commands within the guest shell and you also installed and looked some of the applications you can run from te guest shell such as MTR, tcpdump.

In the next lab we will look at how guest shell is designed to run custom Linux applications, including Python for automated control and how you can also update and operate third-party Linux applications on Cisco IOX-XE platforms from within guest shell.
