# Linux at the Edge: Introduction to Guest Shell 

## Objective
Completion Time: 20 Minutes

- What is a guest shell and why do I care? 
- Setup the guest shell on IOS XE and NX-OS
- Running Linux apps and utilities 
- Platform and software support for the guest shell

# Prerequisites

## Enabling Guest Shell

In this lab, learn how to enable guest shell and some of the features that can be enabled. Guest shell enablement on IOS XE and NX-OS slighly varies.

## IOx

IOx facilitates the lifecycle management of app and data exchange by providing a set of services that helps developers package pre-built apps, and host them on a target device. IOx lifecycle management includes distribution, deployment, hosting, starting, stopping, and monitoring of apps and data. IOx services also include app distribution and management tools that help users discover and deploy apps to the IOx framework.

App hosting provides the following features:

- Hides network heterogeneity
- IOx application programming interfaces (APIs),remotely manage the lifecycle of applications hosted on a device
- Centralized app lifecycle management
- Cloud-based developer experience

## Getting Started

This lab uses a Developer [DevNet Sandbox](https://devnetsandbox.cisco.com/RM/Diagram/Index/1b83c4bf-f63e-4e4b-9119-9b385751f1b6?diagramType=Topology), using the `ssh` command line utility. Using Mac/Linux directly use the OS native SSH client. For connecting using Windows use a SSH client such as [PuTTY](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html)
Once connected via software VPN, you can access the lab's devices using the following:

## CSRV1000V Credentials and Information:
- Username: cisco
- Password: cisco_1234!

Enter the configuration terminal mode and enable iox.

```
device-xe#conf t


Enter configuration commands, one per line.  End with CNTL/Z.
device-xe(config)#iox
device-xe(config)#exit
```
IOx takes up to two minutes to start. CAF, IOXman,and Libirtd services must be running to enable GuestShell successfully. (IOx service (HA) may not run without those services.)

Once you enable IOx you can use the `show iox-service` command to display the status of the IOx service.

```
device-xe#sh iox-service
