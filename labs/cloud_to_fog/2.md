# Who wants to run apps in the network?

Infrastructure Engineers are running apps in the network, where configuration management is an essential operational capability. Plus, this job role needs a way forward for automating operations management and providing effective configuration management. 

Configuring network hardware using Python capabilities on the devices provides programmatic access to the switch CLI to perform various tasks, plus access to Power-On Auto Provisioning (POAP) and Embedded Event Manager (EEM) actions. Edge computing can mean direct Linux shell access and Linux containers. With Linux shell access, you can access the underlying Linux system and manage the underlying system.

Another role that wants to run apps in the network are application developers using distributed applications that can communicate to or with devices on the same network from any geographical location. IOx combines Internet-of-Things (IoT) application execution within the fog and offers highly secure connectivity, as well as powerful services for rapid, reliable integration with IoT sensors and the cloud.

## What is the Guest Shell?

NX-OX and XE CLI platform devices support access to a decoupled execution space running within a Linux Container (LXC) called the “Guest Shell”. Decoupling the execution space from the native host system allows customization of the Linux environment to suit the needs of the applications without impacting the host system or applications running in other Linux Containers.

The Guest Shell is populated with CentOS 7 Linux which provides the ability to use Yum package management to install software packages built for this distribution. The Guest Shell is pre-populated with common tools that would naturally be expected on a networking device including `net-tools`, `iproute`, `tcpdump`, `OpenSSH` and the ability to install, update, and operate 3rd party Linux apps such as Puppet, Chef, or Splunk. 

Python 2.7.5 is included by default as is PIP for installing additional Python packages and is a part of the Application Hosting capabilities. Note: By default the Guest Shell is a 64-bit execution space. If your application needs 32-bit support, you can use Yum to install the `glibc.i686` package.
